# hello-world
My first repository

Hi all!

My name is Germhel and I'm aspiring to be a Front-End Web Developer.
At the moment I enjoy learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In my spare time whenever I'm not working or learning the above languages I go to the gym or watch anime.
Favourite sports team is Man Utd and favourite meal has to be Steak and Chips!
